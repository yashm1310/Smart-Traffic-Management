# Smart-Traffic-Management
ESIOT Mini Project

In this Mini Project:
1. We made a Dynamic Traffic Signal using the camera module of RaspberryPi which reduces the timer of the signal dynamically depending on the congestion at that signal i.e. the number of vehicles at that signal.This is done with help of a weighted formula.
2. The same setup can be used to fine the Traffic Violators by detecting if the car enters a specific range and clicking a picture of that car and storing it on Firebase Cloud.
